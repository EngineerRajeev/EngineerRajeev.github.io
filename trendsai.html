									<p>This might be the year, Where AI Human collaborative deep blue moment is going to happen and it is going to happen in Drug discovery. There are several reasons for that. The cost of computing keeps dropping aka Moore's law. Also, the cost of Genetic Sequencing keeps dropping. AI algorithms are improving the FDA recently approved the drug called Magasin from idea to injection in 10 months. Usually, drugs take decades to get approved, things are accelerating in this space.</p>

									<h2>AI Ethics goes mainstream</h2>
									<p>AI is used to manipulate people in the form of Advertisements in almost all and every major platform. It helps perform mass surveillance by Government and it automates the process of war. Who should get access to this power and How should we regulate it are two Questions which will be top of the minds of the community in 2020. Just last year, San Francisco became the first US city to ban facial recognition. A bold move that will undoubtedly spark similar regulations in other cities this year. </p>

									<h2>ML Skills will be more Valued</h2>
									<p>This Space has matured up to the point where training a model of Data can be done with a web browser. A few lines of code or even with no code. The more challenging aspects of ML will be then:-
										- Model Access Control
										- Database Pipelines
										- Versioning
										- Performance Monitoring
										- Continuous Integration
								   MLflow is a great library for this it helps you manage the whole ML lifecycle.</p>

									<h2>Life Sciences + AI = Solutions</h2>
									<p>Irrespective of geographical locations of participants. This seems to be a way forward for future advancements. Also, what the top researchers have been commenting on is "An emphasis on model robustness over accuracy" which at first glance seems like a good mantra in the domain of AI. But, accuracy alone is not a good metric to be aiming for, the reality is much more nuanced than this as Explainability, Power Consumption, Data efficiency, and Reproducibility are equally valid goals to strive for.</p>
									<p>Above were a few update brief snippets on the AI and it's increasing influence. Hope it could make you a bit more knowledgeable.</p>
